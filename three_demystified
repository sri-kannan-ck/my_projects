What is Three.js?
A Js lib which ease the work of creating 3D in web page.

How it works?
Render Loop:
The beating heart of most graphics libraries is something called the render loop. 
You’re probably familiar with the concept that most games try to run at 60 frames per second; 
this means that we’re going through the render loop to redraw the scene about 60 times each second.

Camera:
The point of view from which the user sees what’s being drawn by the render loop is called the camera.

Scene:
The view that the camera shows is called the scene. 
The scene consists of all of the objects being drawn as well as things that affect how those objects are drawn

Renderer:
The renderer is what takes the 3D scene we’ve described along with the camera and actually 
makes a 2D image to place on our screen out of it. It ties everything together.
