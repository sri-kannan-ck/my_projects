Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.
select name, round(gdp/population, -3) from world where gdp >= 1000000000000

Note: Round function takes both negative and positive number to round the numerical value. If the positive number is given, it will round of the decimal and if the negative number is given it will round of the numerical value.

Example: value : 66442.3775 to: 66000 when using round(gdp/population, -3)

Question:
Show the name and the continent - but substitute Eurasia for Europe and Asia; substitute America - for each country in North America or South America or Caribbean. Show countries beginning with A or B
SQL : select name, CASE WHEN continent IN ('Europe', 'Asia') THEN 'Eurasia' WHEN continent IN ('North America', 'South America', 'Caribbean') THEN 'America' else continent END
from world 
where name LIKE 'A%' or name LIKE 'B%'

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set.
Question:
List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

select name, continent from world where continent IN (select continent from world where name in ('Argentina', 'Australia') )order by name


Aggregate functions often need an added GROUP BY statement.
Question:
For each continent show the continent and number of countries.
Query: select continent , count(name) from world  group by continent

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
Q: List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.
A: select continent from world where sum(population) >= 100000000 group by continent

A: SELECT player,teamid, stadium, mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid) and teamid =  'GER'
A: SELECT player,b.teamid, stadium, mdate
  FROM game a, goal b where a.id = b.matchid and b.teamid =  'GER'
