Collaborative Filtering
========================

What does it mean ?

To predict movie ratings for the movie that user haven't seen yet.

Recommender systems will take the ratings of the movies predicted by collaborative filtering and suggest the user 
to watch it.

How to build a model for collaborative filtering ?

1. Cost function : Min (A sum of squared error ). The one which needs for line equation (?)
2. Gradient function
3. Regularization cost function: To avoid over fiting. 
4. Regularized gradient

Then build the model using training data.
Multiple X and Theta = this will build a model.

Theta is the cost function. (after applying the 4 steps)

X is the training data/feature vectors.

Now run new data on the model and get the predictions.

Collaborative filtering algorithms
Memory-based algorithms:
- Operate over the entire user-item database to make predictions.
- Statistical techniques are employed to find the neighbors of the
active user and then combine their preferences to produce a
prediction.
- Dynamic structure. More popular and widely used in practice.

Example: https://github.com/guymorita/recommendationRaccoon

Applies Similarity and Nearest neighbours algorithm.

How Recommendation Racoon ?

recommendation Raccoon uses the Jaccard Coefficient which is useful for measuring binary rating data (i.e. like/dislike).
After a user's similarity is calculated with the Jaccard Coefficient, 
a sorted set is created which represents how similar that user is to every other.
When combined with hiredis, redis can get/set at ~40,000 operations/second using 50 concurrent connections without pipelining. 
In short, Redis is extremely fast at set math and is a natural fit for a recommendation engine of this scale. 

Model-based algorithms:
- Input the user database to estimate or learn a model of user
ratings, then run new data through the model to get a predicted
output.
- A prediction is computed through the expected value of a user
rating, given his/her ratings on other items.
- Static structure. In dynamic domains the model could soon
become inaccurate.
