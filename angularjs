It is a java script framework for interactive HTML.

What needs to be known to study angular?
HTML, CSS, JS.

And it is easy to test Angular.

When Angular JS has to used?
1. When you need to create a dynamic website.
2. When you need to organize your JS
3. When you need to create a fast responsive website.
4. Angular plays well with jQuery.

Since Angular is JS you have to know when to call the JS in HTML.
It is done by DIRECTIVES.

Directive:
It is a marker on HTML that tells Angular to run or reference JS code.

Example:
ng-controller is a directive that calls the JS function.

<body ng-controller="StoreController">
</body>

JS:
funcion StoreController() {
alert("hi");
}

It looks like everything is a module in Angular.

How to create a module in Angular?
var app = angular.module('store', []);
This is the format of creating the module in Angular. The "store" is the module name and the [] is the dependencies list.

Another Directive:
ng-app : It runs the JS function specified to it whenver the document/HTML loads.

Expressions:
They are dynamic values calculated in the runtime
Example:
<p>{{4 + 3}}</p>

This will be returned back as {{4+3}} in HTML page if no angular is included.

what if the angular is included:
The output will be 7

Example:
app.js:
var app;
app = angular.module("gemStore", []);

index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="gemStore">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.min.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{4+3}}</h1>
  </body>
</html>

output: 7
