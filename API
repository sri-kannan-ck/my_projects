Running notes on API
=====================

What is an API ?
API - Application Programming Interface. 
It says about the features of the library. Through the features, one can interact with API.

Example: Menu card in restaurant. The menu card says about the items in the kitchen. Throught the menu card one can order the items 
and they can get it from the kitchen library.
Sometimes people will have constraints on the ingredients of the menu items which are technically the arguments passed to the kitchen
library.
Finally if the restaurant takes money, u have to pay for your API or you can take for free any time.

API are increasing in exponential way. How to understand and build it properly ?
Start from the basic:
1. Server - An another computer without monitor, keyboard and mouse. It is used to store the data and retrieve it etc. Lots
of functionalities  are there. Most common server is web-server. The server will have webpages and it sends to the client upon 
request.

Simple analogy:
In the same way that a program like Solitaire 
waits for you to click on a card to do something, a web server runs a program that waits for a person to ask it for a web page.

Explain Like I'm Five on API
============================
Like how humans view, post, edit the forms showed by websites, computers view, edit, store, manipulate the data using API for 
simplicity.

How an API is used
==================
When two systems are linked together though API then it is called as "Integrated". Now one of the system is called "Server".
The Server provides the API. API is an another program running in the server. The other system is client and it is seperate
program that knows what API provides and based on it, the program is built.
This is a separate program that knows what data is available through the API and can manipulate it, typically at the request of a user. 
A great example is a smartphone app that syncs with a website. 
When you push the refresh button your app, it talks to a server via an API and fetches the newest info.

So API is a set to rules agreed between two systems to follow. The company who creates the API with the rules that are agreed upon
and the client will also design as per the rules. So both knows what API can contribue.

I don't know the classifications of API. But the nowadays only one API is very famous which is HTTP API.

HTTP API - Sharing information over the Internet.

There is a standard way of building HTTP API. It's called REST- Representational State Transfer.
There are 8 different methods in HTTP: [These aren't REST methods]
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
OPTIONS
HEAD
TRACE
CONNECT
