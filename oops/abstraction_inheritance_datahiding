Abstraction is hiding the implementation details by providing a layer over the basic functionality.It is an act of representing only the essential things without including background details. (e.g. Interface)

Information Hiding is hiding the data which is being affected by that implementation. Use of private and public comes under this. For example, hiding the variables of the classes.

Encapsulation is just grouping all similar data and functions into a group e.g Class in programming; Packet in networking.

Abstraction - It is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object without including the irrelevant and tedious details.

Encapsulation - It is the process of enclosing data and functions manipulating this data into a single unit.

Abstraction and Encapsulation are related but complementary concepts.

Abstraction is the process. Encapsulation is the mechanism by which Abstraction is implemented.

Abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object. Encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that give rise to this behavior.

Information Hiding - It is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object. It is a result of Encapsulation.
