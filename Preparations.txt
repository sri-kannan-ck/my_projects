Which JavaScript libraries have you used?
1.Validanguage is an unobtrusive JavaScript form validation framework.
2. firebug - Firebug offers a stylish console to log, view and filter messages in JavaScript, which quickens the development process
3. Date.js - Working with dates are always tricky. So many dots, slashes and formats. 
             Datejs is a stunning library for simple to complex date functions. 
             It can parse dates like: “Next thursday”, “+2 years” and all formats like 2009.01.08, 12/6/2001 etc.
             
4. Typesafe

How is JavaScript different from Java?
1. Java is related to Javascript like how Ham is related to hamster. LOL
2. Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
3. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
4. Java uses block-based scoping; JavaScript uses function-based scoping.
5. Java has an implicit 'this' scope for non-static methods, and implicit class scope; JavaScript has implicit global scope.

JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that allows you to create dynamic HTML pages, allowing you to process input 
data and maintain data, usually within the browser.

Java is a programming language, core set of libraries, and virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform, 
without distribution of source code in its raw form or recompilation.
