This text file is about how to install electron in windows
1. Install node.js link : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Now open the command prompt and check if node.js and npm are installed correctly. You don't have to worry about installing npm 
I think. I'm assuming pnpm will be installed with node.js installer.
3. go to command prompt. CTRL + R . Type "cmd" and press enter. 
4. Type the below commands and check if you are not getting any error
   node -v
   npm -v
5. Now initialize the npm using the command "npm init" in command prompt and just give enter for every option
6. Now install the electron : npm i electron-prebuilt --save-dev
7. Now download the zip file from github [https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps], extract
   and copy it to the same directory where u are running the commands.
8. Now u have a set of electron sample projects. Run each project like this:
   [Run the commarnd from the directory where it's child directory is node_modules.
    usually the current directory where u are running the commands is the parent 
    directory to the node_modules child directory]
    node_modules\.bin\electron electron-sample-apps-master\webgl
    Format:
    node_modules\.bin\electron project_dir\project_sub_dir
    
    
  
Cumulative of all commands:
1. Intall node.js
In cmd prompt:
1. node -v
2. npm -v
3. npm init
4. npm i electron-prebuilt --save-dev
